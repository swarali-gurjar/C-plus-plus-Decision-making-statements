## C++ Decision Making and Control Statements

## Aim:-

To study and implement C++ decision-making and control statements through different types of conditional and control structures.

## Theory:-

C++ supports various control and decision-making statements that allow the flow of a program to change based on certain conditions. These are crucial for implementing logic and decision structures.

## C++ Decision-Making Statements:-

1. If Statement	Evaluates a boolean expression and executes code if the condition is true.
2. If-else Statement	Provides an alternate path when the if condition is false.
3. Switch Statement	Tests a variable against multiple values for equality.
4. Nested if Statements	Using if or else if inside another if or else if.
5. Nested switch Statements	A switch inside another switch.

## C++ Control Statements:-
Control statements in C++ are categorized as follows:

1. Selection Statements
if...else
switch...case
2. Iteration Statements
while
do...while
for
3. Jump Statements
break
continue
goto

## Conclusion:-

In this experiment, we explored the use of decision-making and control statements in C++, including if, if-else, switch, while, do-while, and for loops. By implementing these conditional and control structures, we gained a practical understanding of how program flow can be directed based on specific conditions. This knowledge is fundamental for developing programs that require logic-based execution and efficient control over code behavior.
